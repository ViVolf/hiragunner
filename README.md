## ⛩ Hiragunner

__Description:__ This is my first Pet project written in React JS, it is a set of mini games for training knowledge of the Japanese syllabary alphabet (Hiragana and Katakana).
It was created in order to understand the structure of the basics of React JS, and also because I was learning this alphabet then - so in essence I was combining pleasant with the useful.

❗ <strong>Important: </strong> Since this was my first project, now I myself don’t like how it’s written: unintuitive logic, useRef is not used (will change in future)
This project is always in my heart, so when I find the strength, I will redo most of the problematic things in it.

### There are 3 types of mini-games to choose from:

  1. __One of three__:
     <br>
     You are randomly given a character from Hiragana/Katakana, and you must choose the correct syllable from three options.
  2. __True or False__:
     <br>
     You are randomly given 2 cards - symbol = syllable, and you must choose whether the statement is true.
  3. __Write an answer__:
     <br>
     You are randomly given a character from Hiragana/Katakana, and you must write the correct syllable.
